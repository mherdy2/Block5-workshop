        <p> Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach 5 to 6 centimetres (2.0 to 2.4 in) and may measure 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 in) along the curve. Fun facts about them click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear/">link.</a>.</p>

           <p>Giraffes are most vulnerable when they are taking a drink at a watering hole. They have to spread their legs wide to lower their necks. In this awkward position, they are easy prey for predators. Usually one giraffe keeps watch while another one gets a drink. If a giraffe is attacked, it kicks its attacker with its long legs and sharp hooves.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe/">link.</a></p>

           <p>Lions are symbols of strength and courage and have been celebrated throughout history for these characteristics. They are also common symbols for royalty and stateliness, hence the phrase 'king of the jungle'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion">link.</a></p>

    <h2>Alligators</h2>

            </ul>
            <p>These reptiles are kind of clumsy on land, but they're built for life in the water. Great swimmers, they are equipped with webbed feet and strong tails that propel them through the water. An average male American alligator is 10 to 15 feet (three to five meters) long. Half of its length is its massive, strong tail. To see more interesting facts about them see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator">link.</a> </p>
